# Netflix-Movie-Analysis

**Goal:**
The project aims to analyze the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset to extract meaningful insights, such as content distribution, viewing trends, and popular features. These insights can help improve Netflix's content strategy and user engagement.

**Technology Used/Approach:**
Structured Query Language (SQL) was used to perform the analysis by querying the dataset stored in a relational database.
Analysis Steps:
Examined content types (movies vs. TV shows).
Identified most common ratings for each content type.
Filtered movies released in specific years (e.g., 2020).
Analyzed country-wise content distribution and identified top contributors.
Extracted the longest movie duration and multi-season TV shows.
Investigated genre distribution and average yearly releases for UK content.
Identified movies or shows by specific directors and actors.
Highlighted missing information, such as entries without a director.

**Recommendations:**
Content Development: Focus on creating content in top-performing genres and countries, as identified in the analysis, to expand the subscriber base.
Popular Ratings: Align new content production with the most common ratings to attract larger audiences.
Filling Gaps: Address missing data, such as unidentified directors, to enhance data completeness for better analytics.
Longer Engagement: Invest in multi-season TV shows to maintain viewer interest over time.
Diverse Offerings: Increase the production of documentaries and content featuring trending artists like Salman Khan to cater to niche audiences.
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content trends and offers actionable insights to optimize content strategy.
